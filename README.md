# 🏗️ Active Directory Enterprise Home Lab

## Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a **Windows Server 2022 Active Directory domain environment** with integrated **DNS, DHCP, and NAT routing**, along with **PowerShell-based bulk user provisioning** and a **Windows 10 domain-joined client**.

The goal of this lab was to simulate a real small-enterprise on-prem identity and network infrastructure, providing hands-on experience with core Windows Server administration and domain services.

## 📐 Network Design

**Domain:** mydomain.com  
**Domain Controller IP:** 172.16.0.1  
**DHCP Scope:** 172.16.0.100 – 172.16.0.200  
**Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.0  
**Default Gateway:** 172.16.0.1  
**DNS Server:** Domain Controller  

**Routing:**  
RRAS NAT configured to allow internal domain clients outbound network access.

## ⚙️ Deployment Steps

### 1. Configure Static IP for Domain Controller

Assigned a static IP to the internal network interface to ensure stable Active Directory and DNS operations.

---

### 3. Promote Server to Domain Controller

Created a new forest and established the domain `mydomain.com`.

---

### 4. Create Administrative OU and Admin Account

Created an administrative OU and dedicated domain administrator account.

---

### 5. Assign Domain Admin Permissions

Added the admin account to the Domain Admins security group.

---

### 6. Install Routing and Remote Access Services (RRAS)

Installed RRAS to enable NAT routing for the internal domain network.

---

### 7. Configure NAT Routing

Configured NAT to allow internal domain clients to access external networks.

### 8. Install DHCP Server Role

Installed the DHCP Server role on the Domain Controller.

---

### 9. Configure DHCP Scope

Created a DHCP scope to dynamically assign IP addresses to domain clients.

---

### 10. Configure DHCP Default Gateway

Configured the Domain Controller as the default gateway for DHCP clients.

---

### 11. Verify DHCP Scope Options

Verified DHCP scope configuration including DNS server and default gateway assignment for domain clients.

### 12. Bulk User Provisioning with PowerShell

Used PowerShell to automatically provision 1000 Active Directory user accounts.

---

### 13. Verify Users in Active Directory

Confirmed newly created users appeared in Active Directory.

---

### 14. Deploy Windows 10 Client

Installed a Windows 10 virtual machine to simulate a domain workstation.

---

### 15. Verify Client DHCP Assignment

Confirmed the client received an IP address from the DHCP server.
